## 1.1 Terminology notes {#terminology-notes}

This Style Guide uses [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) terminology when using the phrases _must_, _must not_, _should_, _should not_, and _may_. The terms _prefer_ and _avoid_ correspond to _should_ and _should not_, respectively. Imperative and declarative statements are prescriptive and correspond to _must_.
